            </h3>
            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                Whether it's one small step, or one giant leap (for humankind), we always strive to meet agencies in
                their domain and ecosystem to build a foundation for collaborative work. Together, we'll assess
                potential problems, explore desired outcomes, and set goals that satisfy user and business needs. Our
                guiding philosophy is "adapt your approach” so we make sure to write adaptability and evolution directly
                into the code and we task our crew with keeping "risk mitigation" in mind when creating digital
                products.

                2. OpenAPI Development
            </h3>
            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                OpenAPI is a standard that allows systems and applications to communicate with each other whether it is
                a RESTful state transfer API, a GraphQL query API, a webhook from another system, an Angular or React
                frontend client, or an orchestration of lambda microservices from Amazon Web Services. Although we
                design for humans, we consider the machine perspective in order to understand how to build applications
                that will automate and scale in ways that make human lives easier. We’re superstars at crafting
                well-documented systems that prioritize the end-user, but keep the machine in mind.

                3. DevOps and Cloud Management
            </h3>
            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                Our mission is to automate ourselves out of a job. We’ll get there by employing tools like continuous
                deployment (CI/CD) and infrastructure as code (IaC) to build safe, reliable, and efficient applications
                without the burden of the mundane. Incorporating cloud services allow us to remotely monitor changes,
                pinpoint problems, and discover new productivity frontiers. We speak “cloud,” so designing our
                applications to scale is a breeze.

                4. Legacy Systems Modernization
            </h3>
            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                Transforming legacy applications is more than just patching and upgrading systems. It involves changing
                the way we think about workflow and data. Modernizing a system means understanding where that system has
                been, how it’s served users historically, and the limitations it faces. We always start with a 3-part
                analysis phase where our crew of engineers and designers meet with your team to: identify must-have
                features, develop a strategy for integrating old into new, and outline a mission plan that ensures we
                meet product launch requirements. Our end goal is a future-proofed system with improved efficiency and
                security that serves user happiness.

                5. Multi-platform Software Development
            </h3>
            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                Platform agnostic applications are the future. That's why developing scalable systems for both humans
                and machines to consume is part of our software design ethos. We engineer our solutions to grow —
                accommodating more users over time and providing a more diverse user base the means to access digital
                information differently. We want to create seamless universal software experiences regardless of
                operating system or device.

                Differentiators
            </h2>
            <h3 class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-3 font-weight-700">
                1. Our Human-Orbit Approach
            </h3>
            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                <span class="text-underline">What that means:</span> Our concept of human-centered design is rooted in
                adaptability (Human: Adapt Your Approach) in both the way we approach a project and the type of systems
                we create.
            </p>
            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                <span class="text-underline">We believe:</span> We need to teach machines to solve problems like humans
                do.
            </p>
            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                <span class="text-underline">And it’s important to us because:</span> When you develop
                systems with the understanding that adaptability lends to sustainability, you write software that makes
                sense to the people who use it now and allow it the flexibility to be improved to meet the needs of the
                people who use it in the future.
            </p>

            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                <span class="text-underline">What that means:</span> We work on open-source and well documented projects
                that anyone can pick up or replicate at any time.
            </p>
            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                <span class="text-underline">We believe:</span> The exchange of knowledge is an act of empowerment.
            </p>
            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                <span class="text-underline">And it’s important to us because:</span> Innovation drives progress, and we
                want to create opportunities for others to make valuable tools for their communities using our work,
                just as the work of our mentors has supported us in our endeavors.

            <p class="font-color-white font-family-ibm margin-bottom-5">
                <span class="text-underline">What that means:</span> We put together a team of diverse unique talented
                folks with a vast playbook of skills from different geographic areas, of different ethnicities, age,
                gender, and orientation.

                <span class="text-underline">And it’s important to us because:</span> When a diverse team comes together
                they bring with them a variety of backgrounds, cultures, values, and lived experiences that make the
                team as a whole more creative in their approach to problem solving.
